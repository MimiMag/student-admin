#  WIP - student-admin

_In this repo, I am (further) exploring several libraries and technologies such as **[Koa](https://koajs.com/)**, **[TypeORM](http://typeorm.io/#/)**, **[Routing Controllers](https://github.com/typestack/routing-controllers)**, **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**, **[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)**, **[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)**, **[SuperAgent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent)** using languages such as **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** and **[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)**. The result is a small student-admin app, where you can keep track of student scores for a ficticious coding school._ ðŸ˜‰

# To get Started
