#  WIP - student-admin

_In this repo, I am (further) exploring several libraries and technologies such as **[Koa](https://koajs.com/)**, **[TypeORM](http://typeorm.io/#/)**, **[Routing Controllers](https://github.com/typestack/routing-controllers)**,**[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**, **[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), **[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)**, **[SuperAgent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent)** using languages such as **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** and **[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)** by creating a student admin app, where you can keep track of scores of your students._

# To get Started
